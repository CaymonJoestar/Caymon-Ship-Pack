csp_phasehead,SHIP,"Integrating a phase coil into one of their most popular destroyers, the Phasehead represents the Persean League's first step into phase engineering. However, whether or not it will work out is yet to be discovered.",,,
csp_solarizedflare,SHIP,"Wanting to make their own verison of the Shepherd, the Solarized Flare is a more defensive frigate option in the Persean's lineup. Coming with a built-in Nanoforge, the Solarized Flare can deploy several point defense drones. Despite being relatively fragile, these drones can provide much-needed support to the host ship and its surrounding allies.",,,
csp_LGbazaarfalcon,SHIP,"A Lion's Guard modification package for the standard Falcon, Sindrian engineers were able to add Carrier capabilities to the ship, drastically improving its utility and firepower. Further, the flare launchers were replaced with the Assault Mode system, allowing it to both chase and retreat more effectively than before.",,,
csp_heliadae,SHIP,"This Phaeton tanker turned carrier was built using several scraps of armor from wrecked vessels and forgoing a shield generator. It brings out a considerable amount of fighter support in the battlefield in exchange for having lightweight armor plating. To compenstate for a lack of shield, the Helidae boasts a damper field that allows it to get more use out of its armor against highly explosive ordinance.",,,
csp_hesperides,SHIP,"Nicknamed the ""Space Truck"", the Hesperides is a cargo hauler that bridges the gap between the Colossus and the Atlas, by utilizing some of the cargo techololgy of the Atlas. ",,,
csp_zagreus,SHIP,"Another vessel that belongs to the Hegemony's original ship lines, the Zagreus offers escort capabilities to a XIVth fleet and a strong option against fast pickets. Pirate destroyers should be on their toes when attempting to take on a XIVth fleet if this ship is present.",,,
csp_Guts,SHIP,"Bulit from the remains of a Low-Tech Battlestation and an Enforcer, the Guts is a slow but tanky son of a bitch that drives home the point of ""Slow but steady"". While it's no Onslaught in terms of firepower, the Guts's defences are not to be trifled with when facing any cruisers.",,,
csp_altergeist,SHIP,"Some scavengers, after salvaging several phase coils from destroyed phase ships, decided to add them to some of their ships in an attempt to make a ship that can utilize both shields and phase coils. One of these ships was a Venture which, as a result of this attempt, had its shields systems fried beyond repair but gained the ability to use the phase coils with surprising effectiveness, such that no additional modifications were needed to prolong its time in battle. Those scavengers, after selling the blueprint of this modified Venture that would later be dubbed as the Altergeist, were able to live out the rest of their lives in whatever can be considered comfort in the sector.  ",,,
csp_Phasegon,SHIP,"A ship that most people didn't think to be possible, but through the power of science and recovered Domain techology, the Phasegon became reality. Unlike its shield wielding counterpart, the Phasegon is being rolled out slowly into fleets. As such, only the most wealthy individuals or high-ranking Tri-Tachyon officers can harness this ship's destructive power.",,,
csp_hesperidesp,SHIP,"A Hesperides that has been converted from a freighter to a combat freighter. Utilizing salvaged parts and repurposing some of the cargoholds, this pirate-revised Hesperides can fit a large ballistic along with a bay fitted with a built-in Talon wing LPC and a modular bay as fighter support.

These modifications give this ship an impressive amount of firepower for a converted combat freighter, but retains the drawbacks of one however. ",,,
csp_Lanius,SHIP,"The AIs of the Tri-Tachyon corporation are a clever bunch, even without their corporate overlords. These machines have learned to adapt, remaining intact even after their vessels blew up in the past wars. When given the chance, these machines will hack into your ship and slaughter everyone onboard, then they will attempt to return to their kind with your vessel in tow. The ship you see before you, the Lanius, is the result of one. Such as an AI coming back with a modified Shrike, after an insane Tri-Tachyon engineer attempted to merge a Shrike with the remains of the AI's vessel. It has clearly been improved upon by the Machines to ensure it leaves nothing alive in its wake.",,,
csp_vritra,SHIP,"A remnant of the autonomous AI fleets developed by the Tri-Tachyon Corporation. Illegal under Domain (and Hegemony) law, and an abomination to the Church of Galactic Redemption, the First AI War saw these creations purged from the Sector. At least that is how the official histories tell it. The Vritra holds the line with its fortress shield while the rest of its brethren eliminate any and all threats.",,,
csp_vicviperpilot,SHIP,"An experimental verison of the Vic Viper superfighter. Using technology only in prototype stages, it can operate without requiring a carrier. The chassis has been scaled up slightly to make room for additional equipment. While it's capable of being independent from a carrier, it's not going to go far by itself, due to the fact it is still a fighter, and it can not hold a lot of supplies or fuel. It has been given a fighter bay equipped with Option Drones to support the fighter.",,,
csp_battlephantom,SHIP,"A more combat capable verison of the Phantom, the Spectre comes equipped with a large missile slot to kill any threats using its small size, speed and phase cloak. However, it still requires a fleet to provide support as it has little option in other weapons beyond the 2 pairs of Terminator drones",,,
csp_shadow,SHIP,"A combat capable version of the Revenant, the Shadow, much like its destroyer counter part, the Spectre, has some of it's cargo space converted into a hangar for Terminator drone. While it's slightly better equipped than the Spectre, it still doesn't compare to the more traditional cruisers in the Tri-Tachyon lineup in terms of prolonged engagments.",,,
csp_thanatos,SHIP,"Another post-collapse design by the Hegemony, the Thanatos represents the best traits of both a warship and a carrier, being able to handle frontline engagements well while also giving much needed fighter support to a XIV fleet's lineup.",,,
csp_melinoe,SHIP,"Yet another post-collapse design by the Hegemony, the Melinoe-class frigate is special due its usage of a phase skimmer, a system commonly seen on higher tech ships like the wolf. With a powerful layout and durable armor, this ship makes for a great escort and flanker for hit and runs or harassing bigger ships with its phase skimmer ",,,

csp_shocktrooper,SHIP,The Shocktrooper is a heavily armored destroyer that trades firepower for more armor than most in its class. It hold the frontline throughout a long drawn out fight.,,,
csp_thornbill,SHIP,"What happens when you allow an Alpha Core access to a blueprint and allow it to make improvements and refinements unsupervised? The Thornbill is what, a result of some of Tri-Tachyon's Alpha Cores gaining access to the Falcon's design and making a radical series of improvements that converted it into a missile destroyer capable of replenishing its ammo mid-battle",,,
csp_MidlineMech,SHIP,"The Cetan is a mech developed by Sindrian Diktat scientists. This particular model is built for export. Made using parts salvaged from countless ships and mechs belonging to the ArmaA Corporation. Its Buster Assault rifle allows the Cetan to take on destroyers and cruisers and hold its own. However, its otherwise light secondary armaments means it relies heavily on its main weapon for damage.",,,
csp_LG_Mech,SHIP,"An upgraded verison of the Cetan, used exclusively by the Sindrian Diktat's Lion Guard. Constructed from better parts, the Cetan (LG) is a favorite among the Guard for various of reasons, including but not limited to: the design, its destructive capability, and its potential in Diktat propaganda",,,
csp_advocator,SHIP,"A carrier primarily used by the Luddic Church, the Advocator is a older carrier design dating back to around the same time of ships like the Vanguard or Invictus. It possesses a remote damper field that provides the fighters with dramatically increased survivability, allowing them to escape combat or engage under heavy PD fire without taking too much damage while the main ship provide support with its uncommonly large weaponary for a ship in its role",,,
csp_motorhead,SHIP,"Constructed using the Vanguard P as the foundation,The Motorhead is able to take a hell of a beating while being able to dish out as much as it takes. It can easily take on frigates and even some destroyers but the lack of shield still proves to be fatal in some situations even though it's equipped with a Damper Field.",,,
csp_slicer,SHIP,"A Frigate developed as a mainly energy platform, the Slicer is powerful foe to other frigates that cant handle the power of its many energy weapons shooting it. Thought if one can survive long enough under fire, the slicer inability to leave much room for shield flux along with low durable hull leaves it wide open for a counter attack.",,,
csp_ruination,SHIP,"A newer addition to the Midline family, the Ruination is fragile, not armed with much and doesnt have much to its name. But the speed and strength of its torpedo  launchers along with built in autoforge capability to produce more ammo makes it excellet support against large ships such as a Dominator or Conquest.",,,
csp_dijeh,SHIP,"An old mech, the Diaz doesnt have any of the fancy weaponry as its much new counterparts. But what it does have is reliabilty. Reliable weapons that have proven to be effective in combat. Paired with its tough armor for a Strikecraft, its a favorite of veteran suit pilots.",,,
csp_heliadaexivp,SHIP,"This Heliadae has been modified and given spare Fourtheeth Battlegroup armor plating by ex-Hegemony pirates to give it feeling of authority. Thought, this is only a feeling and doesnt not have any actual connections to either the Hegemony or the Battlegroup nor is it constructed from the forges of the Hegemony to be a true Battlegroup Ship. But the fleets it preys on doesnt know these facts. ",,,
csp_motorheadxivp,SHIP,"This Motorhead has been modified and given spare Fourtheeth Battlegroup armor plating by ex-Hegemony pirates to give it feeling of authority. Thought, this is only a feeling and doesnt not have any actual connections to either the Hegemony or the Battlegroup nor is it constructed from the forges of the Hegemony to be a true Battlegroup Ship.

Thought, this is only a feeling and doesnt not have any actual connections to either the Hegemony or the Battlegroup nor is it constructed from the forges of the Hegemony to be a true Battlegroup Ship. But the fleets it preys on doesnt know these facts. ",,,
csp_enkindle,SHIP,"The Enkindle-class Droneship Heavy Cruiser is either a Remnant mockery of the Domain’s venerable Dominator-class, or the result of Tri-Tachyon meddling and experimentation with old Dominator wrecks turned into horrible, unfeeling killing machines. Swapping the large hardpoints to turrets, the Enkindle maintains as much firepower and staying power as the Dominator it's based on. Further modification of the weapon systems have enhanced its role as a heavy point defense platform for Remnant battlefleets, in addition to its usual role as fleet anchor.",,,
csp_deputy,SHIP,"A flying slab of armor, the deputy is a old mech design that was brought back after the collapse along with other old designs like the Vanguard and Invictus. Like the aforementioned dreadnaught, the deputy uses a similar armor design on a smaller frame with enough updates to the design that allow for the installation of very small shield generator onto the mech. Much like other old designs brought back into service, the deputy is only commonly seen by the Luddich Church and sometimes the Hegemony",,,
csp_phasetus,SHIP,"To call whatever occurred to this once normal Invictus-class dreadnought mere ""modifications"" would be a grave understatement, like how the fall of a glittering orbital was only a 'slight inconvenience' to Mayasura, or how Andrada's Rebellion against the Hegemony was only a 'mild disagreement'.

Phase rings have been stamped into the hull in a haphazard fashion, circular ring trenches squiggling across the surface like the scrawlings of a child in worship of the Sacred Circle. These rings - somehow - work in unison, allowing this beyond ancient ship to bridge itself into p-space without the hull tearing the ship apart upon diving, and without the phasic backwash instantly frying the brains of the crew on board.

Worryingly, this cursed hulk is of unknown origin. The heretical Knight of Ludd in possession of this craft was originally sighted in possession of a stolen, intact Invictus, and the timespan in between the original sighting and now is far too short for a large scale overhaul to be completed. The only possible answer seems too impossible of an logistical hurdle and credit sink for whatever is left in the sector...Or this thing's existence is far older than previously thought and reported and goes back to perhaps even pre-collapse. 

Whatever the case, the Church would rather see the elimination of the problematic tech-heretic at the helm of one of their sacred dreadnoughts.""",,,
csp_xivbrilliant,SHIP,"""Sir, we have never encountered anything like this. It was able to survive our barrage of missiles with ease!""
""But the military file on the these automatons say these things lack the armor needed to do such a thing, let alone with such ease""

csp_ravelinxiv,SHIP,"Developed as a top secert prototype, this Ravelin is different from your normal standard station Ravelins. Not only in the fact that it does not need to be connected to a station to function, after falling into the hands of a special group of automatons, it was remodeled and had exotic compontents installed into it that allowed it to deploy a Normal Ravelin from seemingly no way to it's side and escort it. ",,,
csp_knifeclaw,SHIP,"Made from a collaboration between the Persean League and Tri-Tachyon, the Knifeclaw represents the best of both worlds, coming packed with a shield generator and IR pulse lasers that give it great universal use against all but the biggest ships.",,,
csp_Dagclaw,SHIP,"Made from a collaboration between the Persean League and Tri-Tachyon, the Dagclaw, unlike it's high tech counterpart the Knifeclaw, doesn't have as good shields but has more armor and superior anti-fighter capabilities. Seen by some as the ""Broadsword 2.0"".",,,
csp_mini_trident,SHIP,"Using spare parts from the Trident and some free time, some Tri-Tachyon engineer managed to make a small fighter drone that can't take too many hits, but is cheap and can shield itself with flux to spare. Giving Tri-Tachyon a balanced, general use fighter. Needless to say, that engineer earned himself a promotion.",,,
csp_Quant,SHIP,"Seeing a need for an anti-fighter platform, the Quant was designed to not only to kill fighters easily, but also take abuse itself, making this ship a devil against fighters and bombers alike, Not that bigger ships should ignore the Quant either.",,,
csp_fantia,SHIP,"The Fantia is an old Salvage drone which had its salvaging capabilities removed in exchange for 2 vulcan cannons. Thankfully, its durablility and cost remained unchanged, making it an easy choice when a normal mining drone just won't cut it.",,,
csp_gusto,SHIP,"Designed to be an upgrade to the Fantia Heavy drone, the Gusto is much more armored than a normal Fantia drone. However, it takes more time to rebuild and is considered a prototype so only a select number of ships has access to it.",,,
csp_scattershot,SHIP,"Designed as a new type of bomber, the Scattershot uses a downscaled Hellbore cannon called the Doombore which, compared to the Hellbore, has less range, less damage, and is limited to 3 shots, while still offering the same benefits of a hellbore, and giving fleets another form of bombardment besides the Piranha. ",,,
csp_vicviper,SHIP,"A Super Fighter designed to kill Frigates and bigger, uilitizing the Terminator Core technology used in the Terminator Drone. By combining downscaled Tachyon Lances with the largest fighter in the high tech lineup, the Trident, and the power of the Terminator Core, the Vic Viper can uilitze the powerful Option Lances to kill ships easily above its paygrade. However, due to the size of the lances and limitations of the core, the fighter can only fire the lances a few times before running out of charges. In addition, the fighter requires heavy maintenance and extensive equipment, which makes fielding the fighter limited to only dedicated carriers or ships with enough spare equipment to use.",,,
csp_optiondrone,SHIP,"A drone designed specifically for the experimental Vic Viper, it comes equipped with the prototype Drone Lance, specifically designed to break shields so the main craft can take out the enemy ship.",,,
csp_falchionb,SHIP,"A super Bomber developed after the Vic Viper project, while not as ambitious in terms of design compared to the Vic Viper, the Falchion nevertheless gives great assistence to any ship with its Breachs SRMs and Sabot SRMs. ",,,
csp_lordbritish,SHIP,"Yet another fighter designed after the Vic Viper project, This time, the fighter is equipped with a prototype weapon designed specifically for it that gives it the ability to offer fire supprt to any ship that happens to be nearby. Comes equipped with a interdictor array to help catch fleeing or agile ships.",,,
csp_jadeknight,SHIP,"The final super fighter designed after the Vic Viper project that was influenced by it, using a old design of VIC's Asmoday as a foundation, The Jade knight unlike the 3 before it, while simple in what it does, does it really well. Designed to intercept fighters and bombers, the Jade Knight is specifically made to ensure that it comes out on top against any opposing fightercraft.",,,
csp_MidlineMechDrone,SHIP,"The Laser Bits are custom drones designed to support Cetan-class Mechs. Armed with Pulse Lasers, the bits are a simple but effective form of additional firepower.",,,
csp_luminous,SHIP,"The Luminous is a heavy frigate that in place of more common hardpoint mounts, utilizes a pair of interchangeable ""arms"" to mount far heavier than normal weapon systems than would be sane on a frigate. However, due to size, power output and flux grid constraints, these weapon systems are far weaker than their full sized counterparts. Nevertheless, the Trans-Am system allows them to temporarily surpass their larger bretheren and inflict catastrophic damage to ships of all sizes using the various options available to it.",,,
csp_luster,SHIP,"A perhaps frightening sight, the Luster is a drone version of a Cataphract. Boasting powerful weaponry and hefty flux grid, it pays for this by not posessing any advanced firepower boosting systems, only having Plasma Jets. ",,,
csp_torch,SHIP,"The Torchwood is a heavy duty, large capacity, dedicated Drone Supercarrier. A sight that no spacer would ever want to see in any number of lifetimes, the Torch posesses enough bays to rival or, counting its built-in Luster Mechs, surpass the dreaded Astral-class Supercarrier. But where the Astral excels in bomber capability and striking power with its Recall Device and Large Missile mounts, the Torchwood is more ambivalent, equally capable in fighter supremacy and bomber strikes, foregoing any offense fighter boosting systems for a Damper Feed and the large missiles for an array of medium missile and synergy mounts, allowing it to better defend itself in close quarters while providing missile support, depending on choice of weapons.",,,
csp_luster_fighter,SHIP,"Found primarily on the Torchwood-class Drone Supercarrier, this fearsome mech is bristling with weapons and posesses a very strong shield, allowing it to engage all manner of targets, from fighters and bombers to frigates and destroyers but will falter heavily in the face of cruisers, capital ships and dedicated anti-fighter destroyers.",,,
csp_ignite,SHIP,"An autonomous AI fighter-bomber, the Ignite carries a mix of Breach SRMs that provide a screen for its main payload of 2 Harpoon MRMs to hit their target without being intercepted by Point Defense. It excels at its role and it is rumored that the Tri-Tachyon Corporporation used the Ignite as the basis of one of their secret projects...",,,
csp_Diaphan,SHIP,"A remnant of the autonomous AI fleets developed by the Tri-Tachyon Corporation. Illegal under Domain (and Hegemony) law, and an abomination to the Church of Galactic Redemption, the First AI War saw these creations purged from the Sector. At least that is how the official histories tell it.

A attempt at an replication of a high tech destroyer that may have existed at one point or another in the sector's history by the autonomous AIs, the Diaphan is a frightening ship to go against on the battlefield due to its uilitization of a Quantum Disruptor along with its powerful armaments allowing it to inflict heavy damage to any fleet going against it",,,
csp_strahlen,SHIP,"A remnant of the autonomous AI fleets developed by the Tri-Tachyon Corporation. Illegal under Domain (and Hegemony) law, and an abomination to the Church of Galactic Redemption, the First AI War saw these creations purged from the Sector.

csp_luz,SHIP,"An autonomous AI fighter, a built-in fighter armed with a IR autolance to support their main ship against fighters and smaller ships",,,
csp_makoLG,SHIP,"A Lion's Guard modified Mako-class Heavy Bomber, the Mako LG trades the original's weapon systems for a pair of integrated Proximity Charge Launchers, boasting an autloader fed by a high-capacity magazine that allows it to deliver heavy payloads quickly and retreat to allow the integrated munitions forge to reload the magazines before diving in again. Additionally posessing a medium energy slot with which to assist its attack runs, the Mako LG foregoes the original's system as well in favor of cannister flak to ward off hostile fighter assaults or missile salvoes, solving its problem of lack of PD, even if not always effective at eliminating all incoming missiles or fighters. As with all Lion's Guard ships, posesses Multi-Layered Shields and Solar Shielding.",,,
csp_fisheagleLG,SHIP,"A Heavy Frigate of Lion's Guard design, the Fisheagle is heavily armed for its size, boasting two medium mounts with which to pummel enemy frigates and harass destroyers and cruisers.

It has been equipped with High Scatter Ampifer, powering up the beam weapons it normally may avoid using and suprising any ship underestimating the power of beam weapons.",,,
csp_bonnetheadlg,SHIP,"A Lion's Guard modified Bonnethead-class Assault Cruiser, the LG variant swaps the ballistic weaponry for a heavy emphasis on energy weapons, swapping the system for High Energy Focus and most of the offensive mounts to synergy or hybrid type to assist in close range combat, allowing it to overpower its enemies via raw firepower of energy weapons but care should be taken not to overstress its flux grid.
